  <h2 id="objective" > 🎯 Objectives </h2>

  The idea of this paper is to combine the strength of the GAN to learn spatial patterns with the benefits of the SNESIM algorithm to use many types of information for conditioning. The result is a hybrid workflow with two main steps. The first step consists of creating a dataset of training images using GAN. The second step resumes building geostatistical models using the training images generated previously and the conditioning data.
